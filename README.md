# About: #
Last.fm is a music service with the capabilities to track personal listening.  It is a great service, but has a bloated website.  So I made this tool so I could have a faster, more efficient way to check my Last.fm listening history.  This is a single page website that gives a quick graphical view of Last.fm listening habits.

# Tech: #

I used [Felix Bruns's Last.fm JavaScript API wrapper] (https://github.com/fxb/javascript-last.fm-api) to get data.
I used the [Chart.js] (http://www.chartjs.org/) framework to render.

Feel free suggest anything! Last.fm has a very extensive API.
